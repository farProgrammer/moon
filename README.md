# Moon  Photo Album :rocket:

This is a project based on The Moon which is Earth's largest natural satellite

It let  the user fetch API of Images of Moon on clicking search button.
  Now  the technology used to acquire the data. It pulls API from (https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod) for the Nasa photos

This project mostly  uses Python, Flask, Axios, SQLAlchemy, CSS, HTML,BootStrap and images from google  

 Flask,which  is a micro web framework written in Python 
to write my routes, Axios to make my calls, SQALchemy to build my database, and Jinja templates to pick up the variables from my routes and create functionality in my HTML. I used CSS Bootstrap to smooth out the styling.

A study for moon, it's evolution and more tried to put all in my project .
